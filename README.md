# Terra De Vera Cruz (Vera Cruz's Land)

Game prototype was developed during programming classes through 2 college years in a federal vocational school in Bragança Paulista, São Paulo, Brazil.

Team members:
- Leonardo Paes
- Pedro Teressan 
- Wictor Dalbosco 

Game idea based on brazilian historical events ocurred on the XVI century. The prototype were coded in Java programming language. We implemented screens using technologies such as WindowBuilder and Hibernate to make a connection between the Database and the code. In short, it was made a basic screen modeling (Menu, Inventory) of a game that tolds part of the Brazilian discovery history.
   
 <b>Initializing the code</b>
 
   In order to test our project, you should create a new schema in WorkBench called ltp_ifsp that will enable the connection
of the code with the database structure. After that just initialize your preferred Java compiler.

> **Obs:** it's necessary to configure the build path that can be done through the libs included in the libs file. Besides that, you should check if your WorkBench password matches the one in the hibernate.cfg.xml script file.If not, just change the password parameter on it.
